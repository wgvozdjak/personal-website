Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) series (run by the [MAA](https://www.maa.org/)) was migrated online to a platform hosted by the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/). As a result, practicing tests on paper no longer truly simulated in-contest environments, and there was no easy way to simulate online testing conditions. I made this platform as a resource for students to mock past AMC contests (AMC 10/12 and AIME) in conditions similar to those of the official competition.

Here are some basic features that this site has:

- Select any past AMC 10/12 A/B or AIME I/II
- Choose a custom time limit for the mock
- Autograding your answers on submit/time expiration
- Similar UI to that of the AoPS platform
- User authentication to save all past results and answer choices
- An easy-to-use UI to view all of your past tests

This site is somewhat irrelevant now given that the MAA has moved on from the AoPS platform to their own website, but it may still be a somewhat helpful resource to practice tests online (even if it doesn't completely match the current testing conditions).
