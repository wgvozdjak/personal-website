Geopainter is a simple 3D graphics library built by and for the C++ programming language. It uses a mathematical field called geometric algebra to perform its computations, and is hence dependent on the [GATL](https://github.com/laffernandes/gatl) C++ library.

Some features it supports include:
- Drawing points and lines
- Applying transformations to objects (i.e., translating, rotating, and dilating)
- Changing the color of objects
