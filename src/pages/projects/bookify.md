Bookify is a website designed to record, display, and analyze your reading history. While traditional book trackers generally have the power to record books that have been read and give recommendations based on them, many of them are unable to provide any insights about them. Bookify aims to augment these features with a variety of methods to analyze the books that you've read, including information about genres, authors, pages, and time spent reading.

Do note that many of Bookify's features have not been implemented yet, although the base features have (such as book tracking and various statistical displays). Given that it is not in production yet, the database used is often paused, and hence many of the authentication features will fail to work. Additionally, there is no production URL, but the source code can be viewed with the link corresponding to this project post.

Some features that it currently includes are:
- User authentication
- Tracking reading history (allows for data fields like title, author, genre, and rating)
- Graphing reading progress throughout the year
- Displaying genre and rating distributions
- Setting and analyzing reading goals
