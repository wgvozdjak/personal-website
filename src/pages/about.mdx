Hi! I'm William, a high school senior from the greater Seattle area in Washington state. I'm fascinated by most things STEM, but I'm particularly interested in math and computer science. I participate in the <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions" target="_blank">MAA AMC</a> series, and I was a camper at <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/" target="_blank">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a> in 2022 and 2023. I'm currently a student researcher in the MIT PRIMES-USA program, and I love both competitive and advanced math and exploring new fields in my free time!

In the world of programming, I've worked with C++, Julia, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and LaTeX. For web development, I'm familiar with React, Vue, Astro, and Tailwind. I built this website using Astro and Tailwind.
