Hi! I'm William, a high school senior from the greater Seattle area in Washington state. I'm fascinated by most things STEM, but I'm particularly interested in math and computer science.

I have worked with all of the following languages/technologies:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Julia
- LaTeX

I'm familiar to some extent with the following web technologies:

- ReactJS
- VueJS
- Astro
- TailwindCSS

Outside of programming, I like doing math, and I participate in the <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions" target="_blank">MAA AMC</a> series. I was a camper at <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/" target="_blank">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a> in 2022 and 2023. I'm also a student researcher in the MIT PRIMES-USA program.
