Hi! I'm William, a high school junior from the greater Seattle area in Washington state. I'm fascinated by most things STEM, but I'm particularly interested in math and computer science.

## Coding Background

In theory, I was first exposed to coding early in elementary school, when <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> was popular. I never really got hooked onto the block-coding idea, though, and it wasn't until middle school in which I formally spent time having fun with code.

In seventh to eighth grade, I learned Python, my first programming language. I was particularly fascinated by the package <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" target="_blank">Pygame</a>, a Python graphics and games library that made graphics and user interaction surprisingly easy. I ended up spending a lot of my time in eighth grade coding random projects that came to mind, resulting in a massive folder in my eighth grade OneDrive of who-knows-what projects.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
  <img
    alt="Eighth grade Python folder"
    src="/about/eighth_grade_python.png"
    width="800"
    class="!mb-0"
  />
  <figcaption class="italic">My eighth grade Python folder</figcaption>
</div>

However, it still wasn't until COVID-19 struck when I really started to explore and learn new languages and ideas. It started with Java, which I'd explored previously and formally learned during AP Computer Science A at school. I also began looking into the <a href="http://usaco.org/" target="_blank">USA Computing Olympiad</a>, which many people said was easier in Java than Python. I later learned languages like C++ due to a combination of curiosity, school projects, and continuing USACO.

My journey into web development began at a somewhat curious place: AoPS blogs. The <a href="http://aops.com/" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> is a resource and community for learning mathematics, and it's where many competitive mathletes gather to discuss problems and have fun. AoPS blogs allow users to customize the CSS (but not the HTML or JavaScript) of webpages, and I decided to learn CSS for this purpose. At that time, I had no idea that CSS was actually used to style webpages: I was exclusively learning it for AoPS blogs.

From there, I continued looking into it, and I've since loved exploring new web technologies. I began learning HTML by coding my <a href="https://enigmatology.github.io" target="_blank">first personal website</a>. I have since been working on a variety of random projects using new technologies (such as this personal website!).

## Experience

I have worked with all of the following languages/technologies:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Julia
- LaTeX

I'm familiar to some extent with the following web technologies:

- ReactJS
- VueJS
- Astro
- TailwindCSS

## Other

Outside of programming, I like doing math, and I participate in the <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions" target="_blank">MAA AMC</a> series. I was a camper at <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/" target="_blank">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a> in 2022.
